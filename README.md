# ANTLR Pop Parser Base
This is a barebones parser used for parsing popfiles used in Team Fortress 2's Mann vs Machine gamemode.

It offers a preconstructed grammar framework used to implement logic to assess any kind of popfile using Python.

The grammar has been generated using antlr-4.13.2-complete

I used Python 3.12 to write this, but anything that isn't too old should work fine.

Python pip requirements can be found in the ``requirements.txt``
